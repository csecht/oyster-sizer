The Ultralytics package was used to train and tun a custom oyster model
derived from YOLOv11n.
The original best model, oyster_yolo11n_960_103e_20b, was tuned for 300
iterations with 50 epochs. The hyperparameters from the best iteration,
#233, were used to retrain that model for 300 epochs. The best results
occurred at epoch 104, and those best.pt weights are used here as the
oyster_yolo11_tuned model.

The training parameters and results are as follows:

hyperparam_args233 = {
    'lr0': 0.00242,  ignored with optimizer 'auto' = AdamW
    'lrf': 0.01009,
    'momentum': 0.92746, ignored with optimizer 'auto' = AdamW

model = YOLO('oyster_yolo11n_960_103e_20b_best.pt')
results = model.train(data=data_yaml,
                      epochs=300,

                      **hyperparam_args233,
                      )

EarlyStopping: Training stopped early as no improvement observed in last 20 epochs. Best results observed at epoch 104, best model saved as best.pt.
To update EarlyStopping(patience=20) pass a new patience value, i.e. `patience=300` or use `patience=0` to disable EarlyStopping.
124 epochs completed in 0.553 hours.
